                <a href="index.html"><button>Back</button></a>

                <a>Want to get started creating your own app or game, follow this guide!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a>1. Use a Code Editor you have and then start coding your App or Game!</a>
                <br>
                <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Apps or Games are typically made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So it requires knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a App / Game on the mpax235 Store.</a>
                <br>
                <a>2. Compress your App / Game into a ZIP file and create a Issue by going to <a href="https://github.com/mpax235/mpax235-os">https://github.com/mpax235/mpax235-os</a> <a id="paragraph">and then click on the Issues tab, click Create new Issue and attach your App / Game in a ZIP archive, then you can Submit the Issue.</a>
                <br>
                <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. This requires a GitHub account, if you dont have a Account, don't worry, registering for a account on GitHub is free.</a>
                <br>
                <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. You will have to include Info about your App / Game, it will have to go like this:</a>
                <br>
                <a id="white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;App / Game name: (your app / game name goes here)</a>
                <br>
                <a id="white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icon: (pre-set or custom)</a>
                <br>
                <a>3. If you chose a pre-set icon, we will choose a icon of your preferring, if you choose to make a custom one, make sure to set it to the Size (1024 x 1024), you can change the Size by going to File > Page setup > (Widescreen 16:9) > (Custom) > (Inches) > (Pixels) and then set both of the numbers to 1024 then click Apply. If you choose to make a custom app or game icon, it has to be approved by us, if itâ€™s not approved, the pre-set will be used instead.</a>
                <br>
                <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. This requires you to be in Google Drawings, which requires a Google account, if you dont have a Account, don't worry, registering for a account on Google is free. (sometimes not due to phone number verification)</a>
